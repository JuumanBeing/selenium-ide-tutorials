Globbing
========================================

## Scenario

1. Use globbing to assert two different h1 headers on the page

----------------------------------------

## Tutorial Instructions

Step 1. Launch Selenium IDE in the browser.

Step 2. Click on "Create a new project". Enter a project name.

Step 3. Set the base URL to: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/selenium/practice/alerts.php.

Step 4. Open the web page.
  - Command = `open`

Step 5. Assert that content h1 matches "Alert" and any characters after it.
  - Command = `assert element present` (*)
  - Target = `xpath=/html/body/main/div/div/div[2]/h1`
  - Value = `glob:Alert*`

Step 6. Assert that the page h1 matches "Selenium - Automation" and any characters after it.
  - Command = `assert element present` (*)
  - Target = `xpath=/html/body/div/header/div[2]/h1`
  - Value = `glob:Selenium - Automation*`

Step 7. Close the browser window.
  - Command = `close`

Step 8. Run the test.
  - All steps should pass


* The tutorial said to use `assert text` but it does not work with globbing. `assert element present` works instead

Explanation from ChatGPT:

Here's why `glob:Alert*` works with `assert element present` but not with `assert text`:

✅ `assert element present`:
- This command **checks for the presence of an element** in the DOM.
- When you use `glob:Alert*` here, you're matching **against a locator**, not against the visible **text content** of the element.
- It accepts glob patterns in the locator (or label, like IDs or names) if supported.
- If an element's name, ID, label, or another string matches Alert*, it passes.

❌ assert text:
- This command compares the **text content** of an element with the expected value.
- The `glob:` prefix is officially supported, but **some Selenium IDE versions (especially recent ones) do not parse `glob:` correctly in the `Value` field** of `assert text`.
- These versions either:
  - Expect globbing without the prefix (but then misinterpret it)
  - Or require regex for pattern-based matches
  - Or have a **bug that breaks glob support specifically for text comparisons**
