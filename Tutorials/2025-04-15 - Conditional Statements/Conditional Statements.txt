Conditional Statements
========================================

## Tutorial Instructions

Step 1. Launch Selenium IDE in the browser.

Step 2. Click on "Create a new project". Enter a project name.

Step 3. Set the base URL to: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/selenium/practice/login.php.

Step 4. For the first test step, in the Command field, enter the `open` command. In the Target field, enter "login.php".

Step 5. In the next test step, in the Command field, enter the `store text` command. In the Target field, enter "xpath=//*[@id="signInForm"]/h1". In the Value field, enter "val".
  - This stores the "Welcome, Login In" that's in the h1 element (located in <form id="signInForm"</form>) to a variable named val

Step 6. In a new test step: Command = `if`. Target = `${val}==="Welcome, Login In"`.
  - If the val variable is exactly equal to: Welcome, Login In

Step 7. New test step: Command = `echo`. Target = "Correct Verification".

Step 8. New test step: Command = `else if`. Target = `${val}==="Welcome, Register"`.

Step 9. New test step: Command =`echo`. Target = "Incorrect Verification".

Step 10. New test step: Command =`else`.

Step 11. New test step: Command =`echo`. Target = "Invalid Test"

Step 12. New test step: Command =`close` to close the window.

Step 13. Run all tests.

Step 14. In the left Tests panel, click on the dropdown below the project title. Set it to "Executing"
  - At the bottom of the panel, it should display "Runs: 1 Failures: 0"

Step 15. Check the Log panel.
  - The Log panel should display a success message
  - On step 3, the echo message should be "Correct Verification" because the text string "Welcome, Login In" was stored in val so the first if statement evaluated to true
