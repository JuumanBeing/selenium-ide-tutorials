Looping - Times Command
========================================

## Resource

Original tutorial written by Perplexity.ai using the following prompt and then modified for my needs:
"Write a tutorial for using the `times` command in Selenium IDE with a real-world use case. The target audience are beginners learning Selenium IDE for the first time.""

----------------------------------------

## Tutorial Instructions

Step 1. Launch Selenium IDE in the browser.

Step 2. Click on "Create a new project". Enter a project name.

Step 3. Set the base URL to: https://google.com.

Step 4. Click on the "Start recording" button to start recording the test script.

Step 5. After the app launches, click in the search field, enter "1", and press enter.

Step 6. Close the window.

Step 7. Stop the recording.

Step 8. Delete any unwanted test steps (e.g. `set window size` and accidental mouseovers)

Step 9. Under the `type` command, we want to add the `Enter` key press.
    - Command = `send keys`
    - Target = This should be the same target as the `type` command
    - Value = `${KEY_ENTER}`

Step 10. Above, the `click` command, create a variable named count with the value 1.
  - Command = `execute script`
  - Target = "return 1"
  - Value = "count"

Step 11. Change the `type` command's Value to `${count}`

Step 12. Under the `send keys` command, increment count by 1
  - Command = `execute script`
  - Target = `return ${count} + 1`
  - Value = "count"

Step 13. We want to repeat the `click`, `type`, and increment steps 5 times so above the `click` command, insert a `times` command.
  - Command = `times`
  - Target = 5

Step 14. End the `times` loop after the `execute script` where count is incremented.
  - Command = `end`

Step 15. Set the test execution speed to about 80% so you can see the test run easier.

Step 16. Run the test.
  - The app should search the count number then increment up to 5 times before closing the window
