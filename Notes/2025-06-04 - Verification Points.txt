Verification Points
========================================

- Assertion commands can be used to add verification points throughout a test script
- There are different types of assertions:
  - `assert`: Verifies that a condition is true. If the condition is false, the test stops immediately
  - `verify`: Similar to Assert, but if the condition fails, the test continues to run. It logs a failure instead of stopping the test
  - `wait for`: Pauses the test until a specific condition is met ensuring the application is in the expected state before proceeding
    - E.g. wait for an element to be visible on the page, so that you can store a value from it or assert that it exists

- While recording, `assert`, `verify`, and `wait for` commands can be inserted by right-clicking an element on the page
