What is Selenium IDE?: Learn The Basics
========================================

## Working Principle of Selenium IDE

- Selenium IDE works in three stages:
  1. Recording
  2. Playing back
  3. Saving

### Recording
- Records all the actions by the user performed in the browser
- These recorded actions make up the test script

### Playing Back
- The recorded script is executed on the browser to ensure it is working as expected
- The user can monitor the stability and success rate

### Saving
- The recorded script is saved for future test runs and regression testing

## Selenium Commands

- Selenium commands are broadly classified into three categories:
  - Actions
  - Accessors
  - Assertions

### Actions
- Commands that interact directly with the application
- clickAndWait()
- typeAndWait()

### Accessors
- Enable the user to store certain values to a user-defined variable
- storeTitle()

### Assertions
- Verifies the current state of the application along with an expected state
- Validates whether a specific condition or expectation about the application under test (AUT) is met
- Can act as checkpoints in test scripts to ensure actual results match the expected results
- In Selenium IDE, there are different types of assertions:
  - **Assert** command ensures that the test execution is terminated in case of failure (hard assert)
  - **Verify** command ensures script execution even if the verification failed (soft assert)
  - **WaitFor** command waits for a specific condition to be met before executing the next test step

----------------------------------------

## Re-useability of Test Scripts

- Many test scripts may require the same steps such as signing in, creating an account, or signing out
- It is redundant and a waste of time to recreate these test steps over and over
- To prevent this redundancy, Selenium IDE allows the use of variables and scripts to other scripts (similar to functions in programming)
