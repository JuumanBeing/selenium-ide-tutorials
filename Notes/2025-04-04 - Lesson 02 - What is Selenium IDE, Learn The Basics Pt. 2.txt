What is Selenium IDE?: Learn The Basics Pt. 2
========================================

## Debugging in IDE

### Step Execution
- In Selenium IDE, you can use step execution to debug
- This allows you to execute each step in the test script sequentially one step at a time

- To perform step execution:
  1. Click on the "Step over current command" button
  2. The command executes and pauses
  3. Click on the "Step over current command" button to keep executing one step at a time

- Step execution is useful when the test cases are long
- You can check errors at any step and reveal where the test might be failing


### Breakpoints
- Breakpoints allow you to pause the test run at any command

- To add a breakpoint, click on the line number to the left of the command
- Breakpoints can also be added/removed by right-clicking any test step and selecting "Toggle breakpoint"

- Once a test is running, the debugger will execute all the steps before the breakpoint and pauses the execution at the breakpoint
- Once paused, you can use step-by-step execution for debugging

- Breakpoints can be disabled/re-enabled with the "Disable breakpoints" button at the top-right of the window near the "Start recording" button


### Play to This Point
- Another way to add a breakpoint is to right-click a command and selecting "Play to this point"
- The test will immediately run and execute all steps before the selected command after selecting the option


### Pause on Exception
- With "Pause on exceptions" enabled, Selenium IDE will pause the test run and automatically enter debug mode in the case of a failed step
- Enable it by clicking the button on the top right, next to the "Start recording" button
