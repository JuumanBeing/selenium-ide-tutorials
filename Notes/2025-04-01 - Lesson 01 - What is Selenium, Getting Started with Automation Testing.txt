What is Selenium?: Getting Started with Automation Testing
========================================

## Selenium

- Open source suite of automated testing tools
- Tests web applications
- Cannot test desktop and mobile applications

### Advantages
- Accurate with results thus making it reliable
- Open-source nature of Selenium makes it free to learn
- Supports multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Perl, and Ruby
- Supports multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera
- Easy to implement and doesn't require the individual to have in-depth knowledge of the tool
- Has plenty of re-usability and add-ons

### Limitations
- Since Selenium is open source, it doesn't have a dedicated developer community and therefore doesn't have consistent reliable tech support
- Cannot test desktop or mobile applications
- Limited support for image testing
- Limited support for test management
  - Often integrated with tools like JUnit and TestNG for this purpose
- You may need knowledge of programming languages to use Selenium

----------------------------------------

## Selenium IDE

- A browser extension for Firefox or Chrome
- Automates functionality
- Typically records user interaction on the browser and exports them as a reusable script
- A rapid prototyping tool developed to speed up the creation of automation scripts
- Can be used by individuals with no programming knowledge

### Limitations
- Does not support data-driven testing
  - Tests where data is external to your functional tests
  - Data is loaded into tests
  - Can run the same test cases with multiple inputs (e.g. login function with different credentials)
- Can't perform database testing
- Can't provide a detailed test report
- Can't export to WebDriver scripts
- Not recommended for complex scenarios/projects
- Very limited in its ability to handle JavaScript alerts and pop-ups

----------------------------------------

## Selenium IDE Command-line Runner

- With Selenium IDE command line runner, you can run all of your Selenium IDE tests on any browser, in parallel, and on a Grid without needed to write any code
- Selenium IDE command line runner needs to be installed separately

----------------------------------------

## Selenium WebDriver

- Cross-platform testing framework
- Can configure and control browsers on the OS level
  - This means it can test web apps in different browsers and operating systems without needing separate tools for each combination
- Serves as a programming interface to create and run test cases
  - Programming interface: A way to write code that interacts with browsers
- Interacts natively with browser applications
  - Communicates directly with the browser, making it faster and more efficient for running tests
  - Eliminates the need for intermediate servers
- Supports various programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, Perl, and Ruby
- Can be integrated with tools like JUnit and TestNG for test management
